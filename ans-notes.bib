  abstract = {In this paper will be presented new approach to entropy coding: family of generalizations of standard numeral systems which are optimal for encoding sequence of equiprobable symbols, into asymmetric numeral systems - optimal for freely chosen probability distributions of symbols. It has some similarities to Range Coding but instead of encoding symbol in choosing a range, we spread these ranges uniformly over the whole interval. This leads to simpler encoder - instead of using two states to define range, we need only one. This approach is very universal - we can obtain from extremely precise encoding (ABS) to extremely fast with possibility to additionally encrypt the data (ANS). This encryption uses the key to initialize random number generator, which is used to calculate the coding tables. Such preinitialized encryption has additional advantage: is resistant to brute force attack - to check a key we have to make whole initialization. There will be also presented application for new approach to error correction: after an error in each step we have chosen probability to observe that something was wrong. There will be also presented application for new approach to error correction: after an error in each step we have chosen probability to observe that something was wrong. We can get near Shannon's limit for any noise level this way with expected linear time of correction.},
